# Buyer persona describes your ideal customer

Buyer persona creates focus. You do not want to market and sell to the whole world, because that is a waste of your time. Instead, you want to know what exactly is your ideal customer group -- the ones that are the most receptive to your products and services right now. Those people are described with Buyer Personas.

The Buyer Persona is a document, where you record the characteristics of your ideal customer. You can have several different ideal customers, in which case you need one for each persona. The information should include things such as age, title, position objectives, his/her superior and subordinates, but also how he/she behaves when he/she buys and makes decisions. Typical buyer personas include the Expert, The Superior and The Top Management, but you may very well have your business specific variations of these.

The buyer persona is an imaginary character, because it sums up the characteristics of a group of people into one, and as such it generalizes human behavior. However, it definitely must be based on researched facts about the group (and not on beliefes, assumptions or opinions). Thus, the document describes your typical, real customer. Further, when you want to address new, potential customers, you need to create a separate buyer persona for each of them and plan your marketing activities with them in mind.

# Create the buyer persona from actual customer data

## Record the basics

A well documented buyer persona is not just a list of characterstics, but reveals the way of thinking of the persona, the way they want to develop their work and make decisions. At minimum, include the following:

* His/her title, his superior's title and the titles of his subordinates
* The industry he's working in and the sixe of the organization
* His responsibilities, objectives, measures of success and typical challenges at work
* How and from where does he gather information to support decision making
* How does he communicate to other when he's promoting his ideas
* Add an imaginary name and picture for the persona
* Include actual customer testimonials, because they make the persona come alive through feedback that you know someone actually gave.

## Base the buyer persona on actual customer data

You can do your first buyer persona exercise on the fly, but as soon as you can, you need to adjust it with facts. You will get these or example from

* market research
* researching your own customer database
* by interviewing your customers
* from customer feedback
* by observing your customers' behavior

## How does he/she make decisions?

Take a step further and describe how he makes decisions. You'll get valuable insight for the persona when you interview your real customers, such as

* His priorities: is your product or service among the first to be acquired or is your turn after something else?
* Success factors: what does the customer hope to achieve by buying your product or service?
* Challenges: why does the customer not see your product or service as his best choice?
* The customer journey: has he just started looking for information, is he comparing options or is he only missing one last piece of information so that he can decide?
* What are the criteria based on which he'll buy? Who'll make the buying decision?
* Describe the channel, the messages and the tone of voice needed to address each buyer persona. The Expert, The Superior and The Top Management all have distinct styles.

## A complete buyer persona helps you deliver the right message to the right people

When you have perfected your buyer persona, you will be able to conclude

* Who you still need to talk to
* What information they are still looking or
* When is the right time to deliver the information and in what format, and
* What kind of arguments do you need to justify your message with.

## Tools for creating the buyer personas

You can document your buyer personas in a simple document format by brainstorming with your colleagues. Internet services include [makemypersona.com][0] by HubSpot and [buyerpersona.com][1], an organization dedicated for buyer persona research. I can provide (anonymous) examples of how my customers have documented their personas.
