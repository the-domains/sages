# Customer Journey: from potential to actual customers

From obscurity to repeated buying. That's what Customer Journey is. In between you'll find different phases, and also different information needs per phase. A person just having realized he needs something goes online and looks for providers. Once found, he digs deeper and looks for product specifications so that he can compare the options. After having chosen and bought, he'll look for further instructions.

What this all means is that you need to provide different kinds of content for those different phases, because the customer needs to make different kind of decisions in different phases. One general type of blog post won't serve all needs.

## A customer journey usually consists of 3-6 phases

The phases in the customer journey are usually called Awareness, Consideration and Decision. I myself split each of them further in two.

### Awareness

1. The customer does not yet recognize he has a need.
  1. To make yourself ready for the time that he does, do keyword research on your industry, on your area of expertise as well as on the products and services that you provide.
  2. Select the keywords that match your specific offerings and create blog posts that address each keyword on a general level. Share the posts in social media to make yourself known. Create advertising campaigns that target the target segment.
2. The customer recognizes that he has a need and becomes aware of the fact that a product or a service might satisfy that need.
  1. Publish more detailed blog posts that describe how your product or service satisfies the need in question.
  2. Create landing pages for selected keywords that include a short description of what it is that you are offering and a Call To Action, that is, a button to buy, subscribe to a newsletter or to download more detailed eBook, for example. This way, you acquire the customer's email address and can begin to address him/her personally.

### Consideration

1. The customer recognizes the solution to his problem i.e. his need will be satisfied by the product or service that you, too, provide. Thus, he searches for information about the different options out there.
  1. For this, you need to create varied and convincing content for each of the keywords that the customer is using. Customer confidence is increased by testimonials, interviews, list and "How to..?" type of blog posts as well as links from other sites pointing to your site. Remember to insert links pointing the user from this phase to the next.
2. The customer is comparing his options
  1. Provide blog posts that compare different options of your own, detailed descriptions of your product or service, user guides, manuals, instructional videos, web courses and articles describing typical use cases.
  2. It is likely that the customer will also check discussion forums for user experience of those having already bought and used your product/service. You may want to participate in the discussion, but the correct way is only to correct false information and provide links to the correct one.

### Decision

1. The customer is considering just before the final buying decision
  1. This is a great opportunity to provide a free gift for the ones still hesitating. It could be a free guide, a special offer, a trial period or a product/service presentation at your or the customer's premises.
2. The customer has bought
  1. In this phase the customer may have to convince another person (a spouse, a superior, top management) about the decision. This phase requires clear numerical content that describes the benefit or the return on investment in a presentation, white paper or flowchart format.
  2. Also, after sales content such as user guides are often sought after in this phase.

## Customer journey does not end in the latest purchase

What else can you offer for the one already bought? Content related to your other products and services might help him/her to embark on another journey.

As you see, it's not at all insignificant what kind of content you provide in each phase of the Customer Journey. Producing all of this may look like a huge task, but remember that you do not have to create all at once. It all starts from you identifying your ideal customer in the form of the Buyer Persona.
