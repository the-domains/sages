Journey: from potential to actual customers</h1><p>From obscurity to repeated buying. That’s what Customer Journey is. In between you’ll find different phases, and also different information needs per phase. A person just having realized he needs something goes online and looks for providers. Once found,
    he digs deeper and looks for product specifications so that he can compare the options. After having chosen and bought, he’ll look for further instructions.</p><p>What this all means is that you need to provide different kinds of content for those different phases, because the customer needs to make different kind of decisions in different phases. One general type of blog post won’t serve all needs.</p><h2>A customer journey usually consists of 3-6 phases</h2><p>The phases in the customer journey are usually called Awareness, Consideration and Decision. I myself split each of them further in two.</p><h3>Awareness</h3><ol>
    <li>The customer does not yet recognize he has a need.
        <ol>
            <li>To make yourself ready for the time that he does, do keyword research on your industry, on your area of expertise as well as on the products and services that you provide.</li>
            <li>Select the keywords that match your specific offerings and create blog posts that address each keyword on a general level. Share the posts in social media to make yourself known. Create advertising campaigns that target the target segment.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The customer recognizes that he has a need and becomes aware of the fact that a product or a service might satisfy that need.
        <ol>
            <li>Publish more detailed blog posts that describe how your product or service satisfies the need in question.</li>
            <li>Create landing pages for selected keywords that include a short description of what it is that you are offering and a Call To Action, that is, a button to buy, subscribe to a newsletter or to download more detailed eBook, for example. This
                way, you acquire the customer’s email address and can begin to address him/her personally.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol><h3>Consideration</h3><ol>
    <li>The customer recognizes the solution to his problem i.e. his need will be satisfied by the product or service that you, too, provide. Thus, he searches for information about the different options out there.
        <ol>
            <li>For this, you need to create varied and convincing content for each of the keywords that the customer is using. Customer confidence is increased by testimonials, interviews, list and “How to..?” type of blog posts as well as links from other
                sites pointing to your site. Remember to insert links pointing the user from this phase to the next.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The customer is comparing his options
        <ol>
            <li>Provide blog posts that compare different options of your own, detailed descriptions of your product or service, user guides, manuals, instructional videos, web courses and articles describing typical use cases.</li>
            <li>It is likely that the customer will also check discussion forums for user experience of those having already bought and used your product/service. You may want to participate in the discussion, but the correct way is only to correct false
                information and provide links to the correct one.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol><h3>Decision</h3><ol>
    <li>The customer is considering just before the final buying decision
        <ol>
            <li>This is a great opportunity to provide a free gift for the ones still hesitating. It could be a free guide, a special offer, a trial period or a product/service presentation at your or the customer’s premises.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The customer has bought
        <ol>
            <li>In this phase the customer may have to convince another person (a spouse, a superior, top management) about the decision. This phase requires clear numerical content that describes the benefit or the return on investment in a presentation,
                white paper or flowchart format.</li>
            <li>Also, after sales content such as user guides are often sought after in this phase.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol><h2>Customer journey does not end in the latest purchase</h2><p>What else can you offer for the one already bought? Content related to your other products and services might help him/her to embark on another journey.</p><p>As you see, it’s not at all insignificant what kind of content you provide in each phase of the Customer Journey. Producing all of this may look like a huge task, but remember that you do not have to create all at once. It all starts from you identifying
    your ideal customer in the form of the Buyer Persona.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="47"><!-- react-empty: 48 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-3474728a-3a23-483a-b971-09cf45e623d0" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="49"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="50"><picture>

</picture><h1>Buyer persona describes your ideal customer</h1><p>Buyer persona creates focus. You do not want to market and sell to the whole world, because that is a waste of your time. Instead, you want to know what exactly is your ideal customer group – the ones that are the most receptive to your products and services
    right now. Those people are described with Buyer Personas.</p><p>The Buyer Persona is a document, where you record the characteristics of your ideal customer. You can have several different ideal customers, in which case you need one for each persona. The information should include things such as age, title, position
    objectives, his/her superior and subordinates, but also how he/she behaves when he/she buys and makes decisions. Typical buyer personas include the Expert, The Superior and The Top Management, but you may very well have your business specific variations
    of these.</p><p>The buyer persona is an imaginary character, because it sums up the characteristics of a group of people into one, and as such it generalizes human behavior. However, it definitely must be based on researched facts about the group (and not on beliefes,
    assumptions or opinions). Thus, the document describes your typical, real customer. Further, when you want to address new, potential customers, you need to create a separate buyer persona for each of them and plan your marketing activities with them
    in mind.</p><h1>Create the buyer persona from actual customer data</h1><h2>Record the basics</h2><p>A well documented buyer persona is not just a list of characterstics, but reveals the way of thinking of the persona, the way they want to develop their work and make decisions. At minimum, include the following:</p><ul>
    <li>His/her title, his superior’s title and the titles of his subordinates</li>
    <li>The industry he’s working in and the sixe of the organization</li>
    <li>His responsibilities, objectives, measures of success and typical challenges at work</li>
    <li>How and from where does he gather information to support decision making</li>
    <li>How does he communicate to other when he’s promoting his ideas</li>
    <li>Add an imaginary name and picture for the persona</li>
    <li>Include actual customer testimonials, because they make the persona come alive through feedback that you know someone actually gave.</li>
</ul><h2>Base the buyer persona on actual customer data</h2><p>You can do your first buyer persona exercise on the fly, but as soon as you can, you need to adjust it with facts. You will get these or example from</p><ul>
    <li>market research</li>
    <li>researching your own customer database</li>
    <li>by interviewing your customers</li>
    <li>from customer feedback</li>
    <li>by observing your customers’ behavior</li>
</ul><h2>How does he/she make decisions?</h2><p>Take a step further and describe how he makes decisions. You’ll get valuable insight for the persona when you interview your real customers, such as</p><ul>
    <li>His priorities: is your product or service among the first to be acquired or is your turn after something else?</li>
    <li>Success factors: what does the customer hope to achieve by buying your product or service?</li>
    <li>Challenges: why does the customer not see your product or service as his best choice?</li>
    <li>The customer journey: has he just started looking for information, is he comparing options or is he only missing one last piece of information so that he can decide?</li>
    <li>What are the criteria based on which he’ll buy? Who’ll make the buying decision?</li>
    <li>Describe the channel, the messages and the tone of voice needed to address each buyer persona. The Expert, The Superior and The Top Management all have distinct styles.</li>
</ul><h2>A complete buyer persona helps you deliver the right message to the right people</h2><p>When you have perfected your buyer persona, you will be able to conclude</p><ul>
    <li>Who you still need to talk to</li>
    <li>What information they are still looking or</li>
    <li>When is the right time to deliver the information and in what format, and</li>
    <li>What kind of arguments do you need to justify your message with.</li>
</ul><h2>Tools for creating the buyer personas</h2><p>You can document your buyer personas in a simple document format by brainstorming with your colleagues. Internet services include <a href="http://www.makemypersona.com/">makemypersona.com</a> by HubSpot and <a href="http://www.buyerpersona.com/">buyerpersona.com</a>,

</picture><h1>Inbound marketing educates and informs your customers</h1><p>Inbound marketing is about publishing useful content for free for your current and potential customers. The daily and weekly routines of inbound marketing consist of regular content production such as blogging and video publishing, sharing the content
    in social media, engaging your readers by commenting and building links from other sites to your site. The objective is not to sell in the traditional sense, but to publish content that serves your customers in each of the phases of their customer
    journey. This will eventually result in some of them buying from you.</p><h2>A short history of inbound marketing</h2><p>Inbound marketing is a concept developed by the founder of <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/internet-marketing-company">Hubspot</a>, <a href="http://www.times-standard.com/general-news/20120205/business-sense-inbound-marketing">Brian Halligan</a>, in 2005
    to describe the characteristics of <a href="http://www.harrialatalo.com/marketing-is-changing/">contemporary marketing</a>. The traditional marketing utilized by companies at that time had started to conflict with the way people were searching for
    information about products and services and and buying only when they were ready to do so.</p><p>The difference between traditional and inbound marketing</p><ul>
    <li>In the traditional marketing the seller has a product or a service, he picks up a phone and calls unknown people with sales purposes</li>
    <li>Print, radio and TV advertisements are created, which interrupt your viewing or listening experience</li>
    <li>Print advertisements are sent to recipients of a bought customer register</li>
</ul><p>Inbound marketing, in turn, is based on you producing so interesting content about your area of expertise that your current and potential customers find it helpful and are happy to share it. This way, some of them eventually end up buying from you.</p><h2>Objectives of inbound marketing</h2><p>The objective of inbound marketing is to</p><ul>
    <li>conceive a strategy that guides you to produce useful content for all phases of your customers’ journey</li>
    <li>produce articles, videos and pictures that keeps your customers engaged in your content a long time</li>
    <li>produce quality leads, which you will get for example by your newsletter subscriptions</li>
    <li>maximize the so called conversions i.e. to help the customers move from their journey phase to another</li>
</ul><h2>The methods and tools of inbound marketing include</h2><ul>
    <li>Blog articles are the most informative and almost a cost free way to produce content.</li>
    <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The search engines, e.g. Google, valuate your site, pages and articles according to certain criteria. The better you match those criteria, the bigger chance you have to rank high on the search engine results pages
        (SERPs)</li>
    <li>Web pages. The individual pages of your site are the digital storefront of you or your organization. The higher usability of those pages, the more chances they have to aesthetically please, inform and encourage your customers to buy.</li>
    <li>Social media. Social media enables you to share your content to a wide audience, discuss the ideas with your potential and current customers and thus acquire valuable information about the factors that affect the buying decisions in the customer journey.</li>
    <li>Customer Relationship management (CRM). Through inbound marketing, you will receive a lot of information about your customers. CRM is the place to store the info in, and manage the rrelationships from.</li>
    <li>Email, especially automated email. When you succeed in inbound marketing, the number of your customers increase so much that you cannot communicate with all of them personally. But: you can automate some of the repeated interaction, such as onboarding
        the customer through a series of automated emails that introduce new customers to your specific area of expertise.</li>
    <li>Analytics, which means all the tools and methods with which you can monitor and measure the impact of your actions on your customers’ behavior.</li>
</ul><h2>Inbound marketing is a way to differentiate</h2><p>Inbound marketing is relatively a novel way to service your customers. Because of that it is also developing fast as we speak. New information is published almost every minute, which creates a lot of opportunities to differentiate from your competitors.
